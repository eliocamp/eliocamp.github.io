<p class="important">Brian Hood is <p>

I'm a Research Fellow at Monash University investigating the interactions between Antarctic sea ice and the atmosphere. 

I'm also the maintainer for several R packages and give [courses](/courses/).

Check out [Código R](https://eliocamp.github.io/codigo-r/) for a bilingual blog about R programming, and [The Scrapbook](https://eliocamp.github.io/scrapbook/) for my adventures analysing and reproducing some of the papers I read for my research.
