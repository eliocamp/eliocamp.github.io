title: Symmetries and Asymmetries of the  Southern Annular Mode
abstract: The Southern Annular Mode is described most of the time as a zonally symmetric pattern, even though its deviations from zonally symmetry are noticeable. How important are these deviations? Have they changed over time? Do they participate in the same mechanisms and impacts as the symmetrical part of the SAM?
